# Vision

## One-Liner
Local observability dashboard for monitoring OpenClaw AI agents, sessions, logs, and costs.

## North Star
Single-pane-of-glass for everything happening in your OpenClaw fleet — agent health, session history, error patterns, token costs, and workspace state — all running locally with zero cloud dependencies.

## Key Differentiators
- Runs entirely local (no SaaS, no telemetry)
- Purpose-built for OpenClaw's architecture (sprites, gateway, agents)
- Real-time SSE streaming from live logs
- SQLite + FTS5 for fast local search across all log data

## Target User
Developers running OpenClaw locally who need visibility into agent behavior, session debugging, error investigation, and cost tracking.

## Current Focus
Get v2 skeleton to feature parity with v1 (agent dashboard, session viewer) then extend with search, error viewer, cost tracking.
